## Checkout creation

Upon creation, `checkout` is assigned to a channel that influences product stock, availability, and price. The channel can not be changed after the checkout is created. Learn more about [Channels](/developer/channels/overview.mdx).

## Updating checkout

- **Updating lines**. Each line (product variant) should have at least a quantity of 1; if the line reaches a quantity of 0, it will be automatically removed.

## Checkout Expiration and Deletion

To avoid overloading the database, unfinished and unpaid checkouts are automatically deleted after a specified period from their last modification:

- checkouts without lines after 6 hours,
- anonymous checkouts (neither user nor email is set) with lines after 30 days,
- user checkouts (either user or email is set) with lines after 90 days.

## Releasing Funds for Abandoned Checkouts

:::info

This flow is only related to the checkouts processed with [Saleor App](developer/checkout/finalizing.mdx#finalizing-checkout-with-saleor-app).

:::

The payments for items left in the cart by a customer who did not complete the purchase will be refunded to the customer's account.

Abandoned checkout is the checkout that hasn't been changed in a specific period. The TTL is controlled by the environment variable: [CHECKOUT_TTL_BEFORE_RELEASING_FUNDS](setup/configuration.mdx#checkout_ttl_before_releasing_funds), a default set to 6 hours.

For any [transactionItem](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-item.mdx) with processed funds (`authorizedAmount` or `chargeAmount`) assigned to abandoned checkout, Saleor will trigger the release action.

The release action is:

- webhook with the event:`TRANSACTION_CANCELATION_REQUESTED` triggered when [transactionItem](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-item.mdx) contains authorized funds
- webhook with the event: `TRANSACTION_REFUND_REQUESTED` triggered when [transactionItem](api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-item.mdx) contains charged funds.

Release action is triggered only once. In case of a missing subscription for a release event or failure in processing the action by app. The release action needs to be handled manually.

To fetch paid checkouts, use the below query:

```graphql {4}
{
  checkouts(first: 10, filter: { authorizeStatus: [PARTIAL, FULL] }) {
    edges {
      node {
        totalBalance {
          amount
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
