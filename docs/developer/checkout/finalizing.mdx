title: Creating Order
---

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

To create an order from checkout we can use [`checkoutComplete`](api-reference/checkout/mutations/checkout-complete.mdx), which will validate the following steps:

1. The required addresses are valid, with exceptions when [`skipValidation`](/developer/address#skipping-the-address-validation.mdx) is used.

2. Delivery options and addresses are valid. [See more](/developer/checkout/address).

3. All selected products are in stock (while making the purchase, another user could already buy the last available item). See [Allocations](/developer/stock-allocation.mdx) and [Reservations](/developer/checkout/stock.mdx).

4. The [payments](/developer/payments/overview.mdx) are processed, unless channel of the checkout has [`allowUnpaidOrders`](/api-reference/miscellaneous/objects/order-settings#ordersettingsallowunpaidordersboolean--) setting enabled. In case you need to bypass this setting, you use [`orderCreateFromCheckout`](api-reference/orders/mutations/order-create-from-checkout.mdx).

If these are satisfied, the checkout is transformed into an order, and the customer receives a confirmation email.

      },

:::note
When the checkout is fully paid, the webhook [`CHECKOUT_FULLY_PAID`](api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-async-enum.mdx#webhookeventtypeasyncenumcheckout_fully_paid) will be triggered.
