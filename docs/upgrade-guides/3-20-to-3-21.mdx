:::info
To follow the zero-downtime strategy when upgrading to 3.21, **It is recommended to first migrate to latest 3.20.X** and turn on the Celery worker to process all data migrations asynchronously.
Otherwise, you will need to downtime your solution to ensure correct data migration.

## Deprecated `manager.perform_mutation` method

Note: This change only affects open-source Saleor users with custom plugins overriding the `perform_mutation` plugin method.

As part of gradual plugin deprecation, Saleor 3.20 deprecates the `perform_mutation` plugin hook. This method allowed to customize the mutation execution flow and call arbitrary logic during mutation execution. From now on, we recommend building such customizations via apps by reacting to webhooks triggered by mutations. The `perform_mutation` plugin method will be removed in Saleor 3.21.
