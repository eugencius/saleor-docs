### API Only

- **Webhooks.**
  You can subscribe to more than a hundred [events](/developer/extending/webhooks/overview.mdx)
  to receive data from Saleor.

- **API extensions.**
  Enable behavior customization, for example, calculating shipping costs based on the package dimensions.

- **Dashboard extensions.** [Extend admin](/developer/extending/apps/overview.mdx) functionality using any front-end stack embeddable into _iframes_.

- **Granular permission control.** [Granular permissions](/developer/permissions.mdx) for access tokens.

- **GraphQL oriented.** Provide GraphQL queries to shape the data provided via Webhooks.

### Why not plugin architecture?

The plugin architecture is popular among open-source projects; classic examples would be Magento or Shopify.
Such a model has direct coupling with the platform,
which can be convenient to get started quickly but can also lead to many issues.

**Benefits of decoupled architecture:**

- **Technology agnostic.**
  Technology stack freedom allows you to pick the best tool for the job and access a larger talent pool.

- **Improved security.** Tight coupling increases security risks whereas decoupled architectures reduce the attack surface.

- **Independent deployment.** You can deploy your microservices independently.

- **Reliability.** Less risk of degrading performance or bringing the whole system down.

- **Scalability.** You can allocate resources more efficiently for your services.

- **Cross team collaboration.**
  Decoupled architectures allow teams to collaborate more effectively compared to plugins that create dependencies between teams and projects.

- **Open Standards.**
  Using GraphQL means tapping into a larger ecosystem of tools and communities as opposed to limited, proprietary SDKs.

- **Debugging.**
  Decoupled architectures make distinguishing platform issues from those
  caused by your own application more straightforward.
