title: Composable
---

A composable architecture follows a modular approach where external components can be combined and swapped.

For instance, you may integrate independent vendors for _Content Management_,
_Checkout API_, and _Order Management_ that align with your unique business requirements.
Such a system composition is commonly referred to as a best-of-breed architecture.

### Difference from monolith

Monolith architectures have tightly coupled components, creating friction or making it impossible to integrate with other systems.
Even though most monolithic commerce platforms have integrations, they often come with more limitations and inefficient implementations compared to composable systems.

Example of monolith limitations:

- Order creation requires objects such as customers, products, and attributes to be present in the system.

- Order creation has a rigid structure where status, date, or order number cannot be altered.

- Lack of external resources; for example, shipping providers must be defined upfront in the systems instead of being queried on demand.

- Price cannot be calculated dynamically using external service;
  custom logic must be included in the backend as a plugin or extension.

### Benefits of composable

- **Future proof.** As your business requirements evolve, you can swap individual components with less effort compared to monolith.

- **Tech agnostic**. Teams can use any technology stack.

- **Global expansion**. Operating on multiple markets might require the use of different components per each market.

- **Independent deployment**. Upgrades and development of individual components are independent.

- **Isolation of failures**. Issues of individual components are less likely to affect a critical path.

### Our approach to composable

- **Batteries included.**
  Even though our architecture is interchangeable with other components, essential components for _Merchandising_ and _Operations_ are included.

- **Balanced approach.** We strive to strike a balance between productivity and flexibility.
  For example, we provide an opinionated product pricing model that aims to be useful for the majority of businesses as is, but you are also free to take full control over your pricing logic.
