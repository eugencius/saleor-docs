title: Open-source
---

There are two common views behind the value of open-source commerce platforms: unlimited customizability and free to use
(given an appropriate license).
While these statements are generally accurate, they come with nuances as well.

## Are open-source platforms the most customizable?

The short answer is that open codebase doesn’t necessarily mean ease of customization.
In a nutshell, typical open source provides a means of modifying its behavior with access to the core,
which can create a technical burden and issues:

- Non-trivial upgrades due to merge conflicts, incompatible business logic, and data migrations.
- Limited or non-existing community support.
- Maintenance and security fixes must be applied manually.
- You would have to fork and maintain the Dashboard, another large codebase.
- Your custom business logic is tight to specific programming languages and stack.

Plugin architecture, on the other hand,
also has [challenges](/overview/why-saleor/extensibility.mdx#why-not-plugin-architecture).
Users should seek platforms that are extensible and decoupled by design rather than open to modification.
Saleor is designed to be extensible via API with all its configuration options.

## Is open source free or cheaper?

There is a common notion that self-hosting is cheaper than SaaS, but it comes with a hidden cost:

• Platform upgrades require DevOps effort to stay updated with releases of new features,
bug fixes, and security patches.

• Developers need to manage their environments to get the latest data from production.

• Scalability infrastructure needs to be in place to ensure that the business is not losing sales.

• Depending on project or team expertise, self-hosting can be more expensive than SaaS.

## Benefits of open-source

#### Transparency

Our codebase, roadmap, and development process are open to everyone.

#### Control

Our users own their data and have control of the platform, even when using our cloud infrastructure.

#### Sustainable

Relying on closed-source vendors means your business is subject to policy changes, price changes, and even shutdowns.

#### Digital ethics

We respect user and customer privacy, and being open allows anyone to examine that.

#### Ability to experiment

Running software locally enables developers to run, test, debug, and experiment with data without restrictions.

#### Security

Open source allows anyone to view, audit, and patch the code.
Adherence to security is not contingent on the vendor's ability to hire dedicated engineers.

#### Community

Open source enables us to build a thriving community of developers and advocates.

#### Educational

Users can learn about the platform beyond documentation and tutorials.

## Our approach to open source

#### We mean business

Our core, dashboard, apps, starter kits, docs, everything is open-source and has commercially unrestricted license.

#### One license, equal opportunities

There is **no** _Enterprise edition_ or _Community edition_ core product.
We want to put the best tools in the hands of every business.

#### Centrally governed

We have a thriving open to contributions, but our project is employee-driven with a centralized decision-making process
which provides a predictable roadmap and has focused vision.
