title: Native GraphQL
---

Saleor was the first commerce platform to fully adopt GraphQL;
We are strongly committed to the ecosystem and its philosophy.

### Benefits of native GraphQL

- GraphQL powers all API and extensibility points; no need to switch between different styles of API due to API coverage gaps.

- Extensibility designed with GraphQL in mind.

- All documentation examples are using GraphQL

### Benefits of GraphQL

- **Reduce round-trips.** Improve performance and simplify code.

- **Type-safety tooling.** Use codegen tooling to generate types for your queries and mutation payloads.

- **Developer tools.** Lowers barriers to experimentation, discoverability, and collaboration.

- **Common among CMS.** Many CMSs use GraphQL, and have a single API style for commerce and content simplifies the codebase.

- **Data privacy.** You can choose which fields and entities are being shared via webhook events.

- **Client driven.** Enables faster front-end development.

- **Schema and type system.** Provides a standard for self-documented Schema.

- **Versions API.** New fields can be added without breaking changes.

- **Single API endpoint.** Simplifies operations.

- **Real-time updates.** GraphQL subscriptions.

### Common misconceptions

- **GraphQL is complex.**
  Consuming GraphQL APIs is straightforward, and in many ways can provide a better developer experience than REST.
  Building GraphQL APIs requires experience, however as a user of Saleor you don't need to worry about that.

- **GraphQL is slow.**
  GraphQL is just a query language and does not introduce any overhead.
  GraphQL is often faster than REST because it allows you to fetch all the data you need in a single request.

- **GraphQL is a database technology.** GraphQL is a query language for APIs, it has no opinion on the underlying database or data source.
