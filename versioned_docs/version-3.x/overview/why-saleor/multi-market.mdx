Saleor provides flexible multichannel support, where a channel can be a region,
business model, brand, sales channel, etc. Data can be shared, isolated, or customized across different channels,
eliminating the need for multiple backend instances.

**Why is it important?**

Multichannel design is a fundamental part of platform architecture, and it is not trivial to extend such functionality.
Even if your use case doesn't require multichannel support now, it can become a requirement in the future,
so it can be strategic to eliminate the risk of it becoming a bottleneck for your platform.

### Use cases

- Operate across different regions with localized content, prices, payments, etc.

- Localization of content, pricing, and shipping.

- Permission management across different legal teams.

- Run multiple business models (for example, B2B & B2C) from a single instance.

- Create multi-brand websites.

### Benefits over multi-instance

**Efficient operations.** Admins can operate from a single instance.

**Development workflow.** Developers can use single API instance which simplifies development and testing.

**Scalable.** No need to synchronize data between multiple instances.

**Faster time to market.** Launch new regions and business models quicker.

### Our approach

**Depth**. Every aspect of our platform is designed with multichannel in mind.

**Dashboard native**. The dashboard is organized around multichannel operations, giving control to admins not only API.
