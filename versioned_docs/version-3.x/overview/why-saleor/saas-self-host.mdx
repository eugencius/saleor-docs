title: SaaS or Self-Host
---

## No vendor lock-in

The SaaS model offers convenience to organizations at the cost of losing control.
We believe users should not choose between convenience or control. Infrastructure needs can evolve,
so we enable a straightforward migration path between Cloud and on-premise infrastructure.

## Benefits of our model

- Cloud users own their data, making it possible to migrate to self-host.

- We are incentivized to provide competitive SaaS service compared to self-host.

- Use hybrid approach to expand to marketers that have legal requirements to have on-prem hosting.

- A single version of Saleor. We don't discriminate platform features between free self-host, cloud, or on-premise licenses.

- Developers can use both Cloud and local development workflows.
